  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <div class="about-copy">
    <p>I believe the World Wide Web is the greatest thing the human race has ever developed, and I'm proud to contribute
      towards its ongoing development by building quality Web sites and promoting accessibility and usability. </p>

    <p>I graduated from the University of Worcester in 2010, obtaining a first class honours degree, which I feel is the
      greatest achievement of my life (so far).</p>

    <p>In my spare time I enjoy making stuff with wood in my workshop,
      <a href="https://maker.rip/">writing articles for my blog</a>, and exploring the outside world, either by bicycle
      or on foot.</p>
